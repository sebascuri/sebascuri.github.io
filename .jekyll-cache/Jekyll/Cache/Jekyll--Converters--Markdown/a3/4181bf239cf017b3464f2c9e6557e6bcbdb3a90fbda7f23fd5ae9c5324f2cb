I"à<p>Hi! 
Iâ€™m Sebastian Curi, Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at ETH Zurich, under the supervision of Andreas Krause. 
Currently, Iâ€™m doing an internship at Google, under the supervision of Gabriel Dulac-Arnold and Marcin Andrychowicz. 
Previously, I did a stay at Gergelyâ€™s Neu Lab in Universtat Pompeu Fabra.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in theory and practice of the intersection between Reinforcement Learning and Control Systems. I care about robustness and control of algorithms.</p>
