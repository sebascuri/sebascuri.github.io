I"±<p>Hi! 
Iâ€™m Sebastian Curi, Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at ETH Zurich, under the supervision of Andreas Krause. 
Currently, Iâ€™m doing an internship at Google, under the supervision of Gabriel Dulac-Arnold and Marcin Andrychowicz. 
Previously, I did a stay at Gergelyâ€™s Neu Lab in Universtat Pompeu Fabra.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in the intersection between theory and practice of Reinforcement Learning/Control Systems. In particular, I focus on how to bring these algorithms into practical methods. I also care about the robustness, safety, sample-efficiency, and risk-aversity (to name some aspects) of data-driven decision-making.</p>
