Hi! 
I'm Sebastian Curi, I'm a Ph.D. student at ETH Zurich, under the supervision of Andreas Krause. 
Currently, I'm doing an internship at Google, under the supervision of Gabriel Dulac-Arnold and Marcin Andrychowicz. 
Previously, I did a stay at Gergely's Neu Lab in Universtat Pompeu Fabra. 

I'm interested in the intersection between theory and practice of Reinforcement Learning/Control Systems. In particular, I focus on how to bring these algorithms into practical methods. I also care about the robustness, safety, sample-efficiency, and risk-aversity (to name some aspects) of data-driven decision-making.
